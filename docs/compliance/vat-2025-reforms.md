# 2025 VAT Reforms

The Bahamas implemented significant VAT reforms effective July 2025. CoralLedger Comply fully supports these changes.

## Key Changes

### Multi-Rate VAT System

The Bahamas now operates a three-tier VAT system:

| Rate | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **10%** | Standard rate for most goods and services |
| **5%** | Reduced rate for electricity, water, and select essentials |
| **0%** | Zero-rated for exports, basic food items, and medicines |

### Construction VAT Restrictions

New rules for construction projects exceeding $1 million:

**What Changed:**
- Input VAT on construction materials may be restricted
- Developer exemptions have specific qualification criteria
- Project value tracking is now required

**How Comply Helps:**
- Track project values against the $1M threshold
- Monitor input VAT restrictions automatically
- Generate compliance reports for construction projects

Access the Construction VAT dashboard at **Compliance > Construction VAT**.

### Refund Eligibility (50% Rule)

New requirements for VAT refund claims:

**The Rule:**
To claim a VAT refund, at least 50% of your taxable supplies must be zero-rated.

**How It Works:**
1. Calculate total zero-rated supplies
2. Calculate total taxable supplies
3. If zero-rated >= 50% of taxable, you can claim refunds
4. If below 50%, excess input VAT carries forward

**Comply Features:**
- Real-time eligibility tracking
- Period-by-period analysis
- Automatic threshold monitoring
- Refund calculation assistance

Access at **Compliance > Refund Eligibility**.

### Food Store Qualification (April 2025)

Licensed food stores have specific VAT treatment:

**Requirements:**
- Valid food store license
- Proper product categorization
- Accurate record-keeping

**Qualify at:**
- Navigate to **Admin > Vendor Qualification**
- Upload license documentation
- Maintain qualification status

### Bad Debt Relief (12-Month Rule)

Claim relief on bad debts after 12 months:

**Eligibility:**
- Debt must be at least 12 months overdue
- VAT was originally paid to the government
- Reasonable collection efforts were made
- Debt is written off in your books

**How to Claim:**
1. Go to **Compliance > Bad Debt**
2. Review eligible debts
3. Calculate relief amount
4. Include in your next return
